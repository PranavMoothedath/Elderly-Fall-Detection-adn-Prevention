# Elderly-Fall-Detection-and-Prevention
This project includes predicting elderly fall using both camera as well as sensor data.
Using only camera is not that usefull as it could probably even classify sleeping as a fall.
We use data from 2 accelerometers and 1 gyroscope for the sensor data. These reading are got from phones.
